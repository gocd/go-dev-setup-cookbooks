Use this in a recipe to ensure it can (this is an example\nfor ubuntu 10.04).\n\n```ruby\nENV[\"PATH\"] += \":/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin\"\n```\n### Finally, this is how we make rake run.\n\n```ruby\nrake :run do\n  working_directory \"/tmp\"\n  arguments \"--help\"\n  action :run\nend\n```\n\n# TODO\n\nLots, including\n\n* fixing the need for action :run.\n* Adding path statements per platform automagically.\n* Adding versioning via an attribute or data_bag.\n* Adding support to specific rake + ruby version (for multi versioned systems).\n* Proper platform support, this should be easy (but a bit time consuming as I don't use every platform ever.)",
